      <li>Pixels have a life-span of 8 generations</li>
      <li>A pixel can replicate only between its 3rd and 6th generations</li>
      <li>A pixel can try creating kids only once a generation</li>
      <li>A pixel can search for a partner only between its 3rd and 6th generations</li>

      <li>Pixel's genes are in range of their parents equivalent genes</li>
      <li>A pixel can be born with either an RGB sequence, or an RGBA sequence</li>
      <li>Pixels are more attracted to their genetic opposites</li>
      <li>The higher the generation of a pixel, the less attraction is needed to match</li>
